The following are "assumptive" anti-patterns - the expectations that we bring with us into them. I've rendered them as statements of internal dialogue. If you find yourself thinking any of things going into a retro, consider whether or not you can set them aside, or perhaps experiment with testing whether they are truly accurate assumptions.

- **THE SHRUG** - "It probably doesn't matter."
- **TOUGH IT OUT** - "It's not that big of a deal. It'll probably go away on it's own if I ignore it."
- **FATALIST** - "Nobody cares anyway."
- **NICE GUY** - "I don't want to make anybody uncomfortable."
- **PARTY POOPER** - "I don't want to ruin the fun that we are still able to have in spit of our issues."
- **THE DEVIL'S POM-POMS** - "Our team is already great, there's no need to try to improve!"
